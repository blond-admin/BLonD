#energy_offset represents the absolute energy difference between the center of the coasting beam and the synchronous particle
#spread is used for the absolute max/min in a parabolic or the standard deviation in a gaussian distribution
#spread_type is used to convert the passed spread into dE according to dE/E = beta**2 * dP/P
#energy_offset gives an offset in dE for the two standard distributions
#if a user_distribution is used it is taken as being in dE
